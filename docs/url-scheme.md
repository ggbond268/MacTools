# MacTools URL Scheme

MacTools exposes a guarded URL API for navigation and explicitly eligible Run Links used by shortcuts, launchers, scripts, and links from other apps.

- Release app: `mactools://`
- Debug app: `mactools-dev://`
- Nightly app: `mactools-nightly://`

The three schemes route to the matching installation. Stable, development, and Nightly builds can coexist without one build intercepting another build's links.

## Public routes

| Destination | Release URL |
| --- | --- |
| Settings | `mactools://app/settings` |
| General settings | `mactools://app/settings/general` |
| About | `mactools://app/settings/about` |
| Actions & Shortcuts | `mactools://app/settings/features/actions-and-shortcuts` |
| Automation | `mactools://app/settings/features/automation` |
| Plugin Marketplace | `mactools://app/settings/plugins/marketplace` |
| Installed plugin settings | `mactools://app/settings/plugins/<plugin-id>` |
| Dashboard | `mactools://app/panels/dashboard` |
| Feature Panel | `mactools://app/panels/feature` |
| Unified search | `mactools://app/search` |
| Parameterless action | `mactools://app/actions/<provider-id>/<action-id>` |
| Saved parameter preset | `mactools://app/presets/<preset-uuid>` |

For example:

```bash
open 'mactools://app/settings/plugins/fan-control'
open 'mactools://app/panels/dashboard'
open 'mactools://app/search'
open 'mactools://app/actions/display-sleep/execute'
```

Use the stable ID from the plugin's `plugin.json` for `<plugin-id>`. The ID `marketplace` is reserved for the host-owned Marketplace route and cannot be used by a plugin. A plugin settings link is accepted only when that plugin is installed, loaded, and provides settings. Dashboard and Feature Panel links always use show/focus behavior, so opening the same link again does not toggle the panel closed.

## Run Links

Only actions explicitly published to the shared action catalog and permitted by their provider receive Run Links. Direct action routes are parameterless and use stable, non-localized provider and action IDs. They never accept query parameters or infer actions from UI controls, shortcut IDs, or legacy commands.

Parameterized actions use a host-owned, versioned preset. The public URL contains only an opaque UUID; parameters, paths, device identifiers, selected content, and secrets are never placed in the link. Presets containing sensitive parameters are rejected. Presets remain local unless the Saved Run Links category is selected for a preferences backup and every referenced action is portable; eligible presets then retain their identifiers across restore. Presets become invalid after explicit deletion and remain stored when a provider is temporarily missing so they can recover after reinstall or re-enable.

Every accepted Run Link resolves an `ActionReference` and runs through the same `ActionExecutor` as Unified Search, global shortcuts, workflows, and Action Grid. Availability, schema migration, parameter validation, permissions, confirmation, execution mode, cancellation, timeout, provider-generation revalidation, and recursion checks are applied at execution time. Results appear in a non-activating MacTools HUD without requiring notification permission.

Mixed navigation and action links share one ordered cold-launch queue. The queue is bounded, action delivery is serialized, and a recursively delivered identical action request is rejected.

## Compatibility

Published routes are a backward-compatible product interface and are independent of the MacTools app version. New routes and optional navigation parameters may be added, but an existing route will keep its meaning. Unique unknown navigation query parameters are ignored; duplicate parameter names and all action-route query parameters are rejected, as are malformed or unavailable destinations.

The URL namespace has no global version. If a future feature needs an incompatible structured payload, that feature will use a dedicated `formatVersion` or `protocolVersion` parameter.

## Security

Any local process or website can invoke a custom URL scheme, so every URL is treated as untrusted input. The API does not expose plugin controls, settings action IDs, shortcut IDs, raw panel actions, shell text, arbitrary app paths, or unrestricted parameters. Command-shaped paths such as `/app/plugins/<plugin-id>/commands/<command-id>` are not supported.

The parser enforces the exact scheme and `app` authority, a 4 KiB limit, strict path-component decoding, and rejection of traversal, encoded separators, control characters, fragments, user info, ports, malformed queries, and duplicate parameters. The router records only bounded diagnostic codes and route shapes; it never logs the complete URL or query values.

Do not put secrets in URL parameters. Rejected links produce a diagnostic reason, but MacTools does not log complete public URLs or query values.

## Finder Sync compatibility

The existing `mactools://right-click/...` namespace is reserved for the bundled Finder Sync extension and remains backward-compatible. It is separate from the public `app` namespace; individual plugins must not register their own URL schemes.
